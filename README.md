# Clear Measure Bootcamp for MVC6

**This project is the starting point for folks taking part in the Clear Measure Bootcamp 
for MVC6.** 

This course is a feature-driven walkthrough that guides participants through
a series of improvements to an existing code base, demonstrating best pracitices and 
and working through scenarios targetting 300- and 400-level developers.

## Application Overview

The starting point is an expense report application with a very limited feature set, and
room to improve. You will work through defining and prioritizing new features, then work 
in pairs to build these out.

## Roadmap

The MVC Framework 6 is part of ASP.NET 5 and continues to evolve. The RTM (go-live) 
release is [scheduled for Q1 of 2016](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Roadmap). We are building out this sample and giving 
guidance to developers throughout this evolution and stabilization, and will be updating
this solution from time-to-time along the way.

## Pre-requisites

You will need to have the following installed for this project to work:

 - [Visual Studio 2015 RTM] (https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs)
 - [SQL Server Express 2014] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/server-cloud/products/sql-server-editions/sql-server-express.aspx) with an instance named SQLEXPRESS2014 (for other options, see note below)
 - A GitHub account ([good thing you're already here](https://github.com/join))

If you do not have SQL Server Express 2014 or have named your instance otherwise, create 
a user-level environment variable called "dbServer" with the correct connection string
information.
